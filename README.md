# Advanced R - Notes

This repository is aimed to keep a summary of the topics covered in the 2nd edition of the book [Advanced R](https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Second-Chapman-Hall-CRC/dp/0815384572) authored by Hadley Wickham.

The notes are written in Markdown style on the [Wiki](https://github.com/alexandrehsd/Advanced-R-Notes/wiki) page of this repo.

In addition, the _textbook_ can be found [here](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) and also the _solutions_ of the exercises of each chapter are provided by Malte Grosser and Henning Bumann by following this [link](https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/).

Some part of the text (mostly the clearer and concise parts) was fully copied from the textbook but the intent is not to plagiarize the author's words. Besides, some notes were written by me alone, in which cases I offer my personal interpretation about the topic being discussed. I take full responsibility for any missinterpretation that could've happened in my learning process. Finally, this repository only exists to be an easy way to me to get some answers to my future programming challenges. 

I strongly encourage you to buy the original book or to read its online version.
